# Simple Open Glyph Set

You can find the generated images in the `mainOutput` folder. Some additional files are included in the `supplemental` folder, including the fonts and janky code used to generate the images.

### Color Schemes Used
- [Paul Tol's colorblind friendly color schemes.](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/)
- [Paul Centore's conversion of Munsell centroids into RGB](https://www.munsellcolourscienceforpainters.com/ISCCNBS/ISCCNBSSystem.html)

### Fonts used

I've stuck with public domain fonts as the input for this release, and included these fonts in the download.

- Most of the characters come from [Quivira](http://www.quivira-font.com/), by Alexander Lange.
- This set also makes use of some goofy public domain fonts by [Typodermic Fonts Inc](https://typodermicfonts.com/public-domain/).
- A custom set of digits I made based on an xkcd strip. These glyphs are also in the public domain, but the font is not included in this release. See below.


In reference to [this XKCD strip](https://xkcd.com/2206/) about "capital numbers", I put together my own rendition, which you can see below. But alas, I know very little about font creation tools. And while I was able to just barely mangle another font enough to replace its numbers, the resulting file, `ComputerMavisSerif-Roman_0.ttf`, is currently in too shameful a state to share.
