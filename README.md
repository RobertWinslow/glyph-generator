# Glyph Generator
Generates a large number of visually distinct open license images.

After watching [this video by Matt Parker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTDKqW_GLkw), I was inspired to make my own version of "Myriad Monomatch" using only open-license images.


**Problem:** I need over 10,000 such images to make the cards.

**Solution:** Unicode fonts already contain many visually distinct glyphs. So I multiply several-hundred characters from open fonts with a set of backgrounds I made myself.
Varying colors are added as an extra source of visual distinction, but are not themselves used to distinguish between pips.



## Examples

Here are some examples of output from version 1 of the generator: 

<table><tr><td>
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph3-127.svg" width="100">
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph4-147.svg" width="100">
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph5-28.svg" width="100">
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph2-400.svg" width="100">
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph1-299.svg" width="100">
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph6-36.svg" width="100">
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph7-99.svg" width="100">
<img src="v1-SVGfill/outputvectors/glyph8-536.svg" width="100">
</td></tr></table>
